# @ai-sdk-tools/artifacts

## 0.7.0-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix infinite re-render issue in useArtifacts hook with include/exclude options

  - Replace useState + useEffect with useMemo for cleaner, more efficient implementation
  - Fix infinite re-render caused by array reference changes in dependencies
  - Use stable string keys (includeKey, excludeKey) for proper dependency tracking
  - Significantly reduce code complexity while maintaining all functionality
  - Improve performance by eliminating unnecessary state management overhead

## 0.7.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- Add include/exclude filtering to useArtifacts hook

  - Add `include?: string[]` option to only listen to specified artifact types
  - Add `exclude?: string[]` option to ignore specified artifact types
  - Implement proper filtering logic that handles both include and exclude options
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing useArtifacts usage
  - Perfect for building focused artifact UIs that only care about specific types

## 0.7.0-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- feat: enhance artifact versioning with createdAt timestamps and add useArtifacts hook

  - Add createdAt timestamp comparison for more accurate artifact versioning
  - Add useArtifacts hook for listening to all artifacts with filtering options (include/exclude)
  - Add extractAllArtifactsFromMessages function for comprehensive artifact extraction
  - Update version comparison logic to consider both version and createdAt timestamps
  - Improve artifact management across all types with better filtering capabilities

## 1.0.0-beta.3

### Minor Changes

- Major performance update: Unified high-performance implementation

  **Store Package:**

  - Unified experimental implementation as the main and only solution
  - 2-4x faster performance with all hooks
  - O(1) message lookups with hash map indexing
  - Batched updates with priority scheduling
  - Deep equality checks prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Advanced throttling with scheduler.postTask
  - Memoized selectors with automatic caching
  - SSR compatible with Next.js App Router
  - Solves server messages re-render issues

  **Artifacts Package:**

  - Updated to work seamlessly with unified store
  - No more compatibility layers needed
  - Improved performance through optimized store integration

  **Devtools Package:**

  - Fixed SSR compatibility issues
  - Added proper "use client" directive
  - Works correctly with unified store implementation

  **Breaking Changes:**

  - Requires wrapping app with `<Provider>` component
  - No more `storeId` parameter needed (uses React Context)
  - Some legacy exports removed (migration guide available)
